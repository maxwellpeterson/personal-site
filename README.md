A portfolio site for some of the projects I've worked on.

## Motivation

As I started to spend more time working on my own programming projects, I wanted a place to keep track of the work I've done, and the progress I've made as a developer. This website is designed to serve that purpose, and provided an excellent learning experience along the way. While the content is lacking right now, over time it will become populated with new projects.

## Process

I was learning how to build this site as I was actually building it. I didn't start with any detailled prototypes, and focused on creating a simple, scalable foundation that could be styled more ambitiously in the future. I chose to use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) since it seemed well suited to building portfolio sites, and I found it friendly to work with for a newcomer like myself. I had to learn the basics of [React](https://reactjs.org/), and decided on [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for handling CSS. With that sorted out, I was ready to start building, open to adaptations along the way.

After putting together a simplified home page, I started working with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to separate the site content from the front-facing code. Moving forward, this made additions and updates to the written sections of the site super easy. By this point, I was happy with the desktop version of the site, and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). From there, I focused on making my layouts more responsive, and improving search engine optimization.

## Improvement

Eventually I would like to add dedicated pages for explaining some of my larger projects, instead of just linking them to a GitHub repository. Adding a dark theme would also be a good design update.
