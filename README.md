_One typeface to rule them all._

## Motivation

As I spend more time working on my own programming projects, I wanted a place to keep track of the work I've done, and the progress I've made as a developer. This website is designed to serve that purpose, and provided an excellent learning opportunity along the way. While the content is a little lonely right now, it should grow crowded with new projects in the years to come.

## Process

I was learning how to build this site as I was actually building it. I didn't start with any detailled prototypes, and focused on creating a simple, scalable foundation that could be styled more ambitiously in the future. I chose [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) since it seemed ideally suited to building portfolio sites, and found it friendly to work with for a beginner like myself. After learning the basics of [React](https://reactjs.org/), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) seemed like a logical combination for handling styles. With that sorted out, I was ready to start building, open to adaptation along the way.

After putting together a simplified home page, I started working with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to separate the site content from the front-facing code. This made additions and updates to the written sections of the site super easy. By this point, I was happy with the desktop version of the site, and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). From there, I focused on making my layouts more responsive, and improving search engine optimization.

## Future Improvements

Eventually I would like to add dedicated pages for explaining some of my larger projects, instead of just linking them to a GitHub repository. Adding a dark theme would also be a good design update.
